  ### About Me

  With 19 years of experience in IT and software development, I’ve been tackling complex challenges since I was 15. Starting with a foundation in hardware and systems, I’ve advanced to roles where I manage projects, drive quality, and mentor teams, with 12 years at Apple honing my skills in technical support, training, and project management.
  
  In previous roles, I modernized legacy systems, supported large-scale IT operations, and led infrastructure upgrades. As an I.T. Specialist, I helped transform a major distributor’s operations, implementing new accounting, inventory, and network systems. I’ve also supported development life cycles at Apple, managed backlogs, and delivered training programs to improve both team capabilities and customer experience.
  
  Beyond technical skills, I’m a lifelong learner, always sharpening my knowledge of Swift, iOS development, and project management. I enjoy sharing this knowledge, mentoring others, and contributing to projects that align with my passion for mental and physical wellness.
  
  In my free time, I love baking from scratch, organizing events, and volunteering on projects that foster community engagement and growth.
