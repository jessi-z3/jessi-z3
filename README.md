## Overview

I have 17 years of problem solving and coding experience. I started workinng in I.T. at only 15 years old. My father and grandfather did I.T. before me, and I grew up with a keyboard in my hands. By the time I was 15, I knew enough to update computers, remove viruses, change out faulty power supplies, make websites, plus sell computers and accessories.

I have been the sole I.T. Specialist for the second largest distributors in the balloon and floral accessory industry, supporting teleconferencing, telemarketing, shipping machines, and C-Suite workstations. We brought this company from a COBOL based system, implented new accounting and inventory software, re-ran the entire network, installed security cameras and biometric punch clock.

Now I have ten years in at one of the largest tech companies in the world. I've managed projects and teams of people, driving quality and efficiency with compassion and collaboration. I've mananged the backlog and supported the software development life cycle. I have also led training projects, assessing needs, creating content, delivering, and measuring success.

I love to learn and am a lifelong learner, spending time weekly increasing or sharpening my skill set. I enjoy baking from scratch for my friends and family, and in my free time, I plan and organize events from weddings to music festivals. I am passionate about volunteering my time and skills to causes that are important to me. I've been a youth leader and coach, I brought a community garden to my town, and I have worked on multiple web projects dedicated to mental and physical wellness.
